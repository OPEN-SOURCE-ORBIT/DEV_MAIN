      <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
      <p>
        At Dev Elevate, we are committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment where contributors can work together respectfully, creatively, and collaboratively. Our goal is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background or identity, feels welcome and valued. We believe that diversity of thought and experience strengthens our community, and we strive to create an environment where all individuals can thrive.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Standards</h2>
      <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Our community thrives on positive interaction, respect, and collaboration. The following behaviors are key to creating a constructive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be respectful and inclusive:</strong> Everyone deserves to feel respected, whether it's through tone, words, or actions. Avoid making assumptions about people based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. Create space for diverse perspectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Be collaborative:</strong> Working together, sharing knowledge, and helping others succeed makes the community stronger. Collaboration means communicating openly, asking questions, and supporting each other’s growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise empathy and kindness:</strong> Approach every interaction with understanding and care. Even when disagreements occur, it’s important to listen actively, express your viewpoint thoughtfully, and offer feedback in a constructive way.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide and accept constructive feedback:</strong> Criticism should be focused on ideas, not people. When giving feedback, aim to be specific, actionable, and respectful. Similarly, when receiving feedback, approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Take responsibility for our mistakes and learn from them:</strong> Everyone makes mistakes. When this happens, acknowledge them, apologize where necessary, and take steps to prevent similar issues in the future. This helps foster trust and growth within the community.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        While we encourage open and healthy debate, certain behaviors undermine our community’s values and are not tolerated. The following actions are considered unacceptable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Harassment of any kind:</strong> Harassment includes any form of unwelcome behavior, including verbal or physical intimidation, bullying, or any kind of action that creates an uncomfortable or hostile environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Discriminatory jokes and language:</strong> Remarks or actions that marginalize people based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or other identities are never acceptable. This includes using offensive language or making jokes that target a specific group.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal or political attacks:</strong> Personal insults or attacks, as well as political arguments that serve to divide rather than unite, are not welcome. Everyone should feel comfortable expressing their ideas without fear of personal attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Publishing others' private information:</strong> Respect others' privacy. Sharing someone’s private or confidential information without their consent, including personal details or contact information, is a violation of trust and a breach of privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate:</strong> Any behavior that goes against the spirit of our community’s core values—such as aggression, trolling, or creating unnecessary conflict—will not be tolerated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Enforcement</h2>
      <p>
        In cases where unacceptable behavior occurs, it is important that all community members feel empowered to report it. If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please reach out to the project team as soon as possible. We will review all reports and take appropriate action to address the situation. Actions may include warnings, temporary suspension of privileges, or permanent removal from the community depending on the severity of the behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our aim is to handle situations in a fair and transparent manner, ensuring that both the complainant and the accused have a chance to express their perspective. We value honesty, fairness, and openness in the process.
      </p>

      <h2>Attribution</h2>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0. The Contributor Covenant is a widely recognized standard used in many open-source projects to create and maintain a positive community culture. You can learn more about it at <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor Covenant, version 2.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that adhering to a clear Code of Conduct is essential for ensuring that Dev Elevate remains a safe, welcoming, and productive space for everyone. By participating in our community, you agree to uphold these standards and contribute to the positive atmosphere we all strive to create.
