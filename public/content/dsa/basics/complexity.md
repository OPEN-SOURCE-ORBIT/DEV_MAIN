# Understanding Time & Space Complexity

Time and space complexity analysis is fundamental to writing efficient algorithms. Let's explore how we analyze algorithm performance using Big O notation.

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation describes the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm. It helps us understand how our algorithm's performance scales with input size.

### Common Time Complexities

1. **O(1) - Constant Time**
   ```python
   def get_first_element(arr):
       return arr[0]  # Always one operation
   ```

2. **O(n) - Linear Time**
   ```python
   def find_element(arr, target):
       for element in arr:
           if element == target:
               return True
       return False
   ```

3. **O(nÂ²) - Quadratic Time**
   ```python
   def bubble_sort(arr):
       n = len(arr)
       for i in range(n):
           for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
               if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                   arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
   ```

## Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to input size.

### Examples:

1. **O(1) Space**
   ```python
   def sum_array(arr):
       total = 0  # Single variable
       for num in arr:
           total += num
       return total
   ```

2. **O(n) Space**
   ```python
   def create_double_array(arr):
       return [x * 2 for x in arr]  # New array same size as input
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Consider both time and space complexity
2. Look for ways to reduce complexity
3. Balance readability with performance
4. Use appropriate data structures

## Common Pitfalls

1. Nested loops without need
2. Unnecessary space allocation
3. Redundant calculations
4. Ignoring input size impact

Remember: The goal is to write efficient code that scales well with input size while maintaining readability and maintainability.
