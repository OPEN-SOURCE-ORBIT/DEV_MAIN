        <li>
          <strong>Fork the Repository</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Start by forking our repository on GitHub. This creates a personal copy of the repository under your account, where you can make changes without affecting the original project.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Up Development Environment</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Follow our setup guide in the README to install necessary dependencies and get your local environment running. You'll need [insert tools like Node.js, Docker, etc.].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pick an Issue</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Browse the issues list to find something you'd like to work on. Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" if you're just getting started. If you're unsure, feel free to ask the maintainers for guidance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Submit Your Changes</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Once you've completed your changes, create a pull request (PR) with a detailed description. Make sure to reference the issue number if your PR fixes or addresses a specific issue.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">To ensure a smooth contribution process, we ask that you adhere to the following best practices:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Keep pull requests small and focused. This makes it easier to review and integrate changes quickly.</li>
        <li>Test your changes locally before submitting a pull request. This helps prevent bugs and issues in the codebase.</li>
        <li>Communicate clearly. If you're unsure about something or need help, don't hesitate to ask for assistance from the community or maintainers.</li>
        <li>Stay respectful. This is an open-source community, and we value kindness, collaboration, and constructive feedback.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Merge Conflicts</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">If you encounter a merge conflict, it means there are changes in the code that conflict with your branch. You can resolve this by pulling the latest changes from the main branch and manually resolving the conflicts in your code editor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build Failures</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">If the build fails on your branch, review the error messages carefully. Often, the issue is related to missing dependencies or incorrect configurations. Follow the troubleshooting steps in our [contribution guide](link-to-guide) to resolve build errors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Style Violations</strong>
          <p class="text-gray-700">We use [specific linting tools] to enforce coding standards. If your code doesn’t pass the linting tests, you can fix it by running the linter locally and making necessary changes.</p>
